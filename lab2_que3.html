  <h1>Importance of Healthy Living</h1>
  
  <h2>Physical Health</h2>
  <p>Maintaining <span class="highlight">physical health</span> is essential for leading a long and fulfilling life. It helps us stay energized, boosts our immune system, and prevents many chronic diseases. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep are the pillars of physical well-being. Exercise strengthens muscles and improves cardiovascular health. Eating a <span class="highlight">nutritious diet</span> provides the body with essential nutrients to function properly. Sleep helps restore our body and mind, preparing us for the challenges of each day.</p>

  <h2>Mental Well-being</h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">Mental health</span> is just as important as physical health. Managing stress, staying positive, and seeking support when needed contribute to mental well-being. Activities like meditation and mindfulness improve emotional stability. Spending time with loved ones and engaging in hobbies also helps reduce anxiety. Being mentally healthy enables us to cope with challenges effectively and maintain healthy relationships. A strong mind leads to a <span class="highlight">happier and more balanced life</span>.</p>
  
  <h2>Social Connections</h2>
  <p>Having strong social connections is vital for emotional health. Humans are naturally social beings who thrive on interaction. Building <span class="highlight">supportive relationships</span> reduces feelings of isolation and enhances overall happiness. Whether it's family, friends, or colleagues, having someone to share experiences with can be comforting. Engaging with communities, participating in social events, and giving back to society create a sense of belonging. Social support is a key component of both mental and physical well-being.</p>
