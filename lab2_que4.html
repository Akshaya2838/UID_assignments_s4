        <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This web page is designed with an external CSS
        file to give it a clean and consistent style.
        Using a universal selector in the CSS, we apply 
        some basic styles to all elements on the page.
        This makes it easy to maintain a consistent look
        across the entire site.</p>
        <h2>Why Use External CSS?</h2>
    <p>External CSS allows us to separate content 
        from design. It makes our HTML code cleaner 
        and easier to read. The same stylesheet can 
        be reused for multiple pages, saving time and 
        effort. With the help of a universal selector,
        we can apply base styles to all elements effortlessly.</p>
    <h2>Adding an Image</h2>
    <p>Images enhance the visual appeal of a web page. 
    Below is an example image that showcases the beauty 
    of nature. Proper use of images can make a web page 
    more engaging and informative.</p>
